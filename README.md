<h2><i> A C program for huffman encoding (not completed yet) </h2><i><br><br>

Following the huffman encoding theory, I am trying to develope a program in C to achieve encoding any input (text, text file, images, etc..) <br>
and reducing the size.

The program will be used through terminal (no GUI involved at this stage) <br>

I achieved about 80% of the objective.
